# campus-energy-dashboard-Aryan-

This project implements a complete campus energy monitoring pipeline that ingests electricity meter data from multiple buildings, performs daily and weekly aggregations, and generates both visual and textual summaries. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the pipeline cleans and merges raw data, applies object-oriented modeling for buildings and readings, creates a multi-chart dashboard, and exports summary reports. It is designed to help facilities teams analyze consumption patterns, identify peak loads, and support data-driven energy-saving decisions.
